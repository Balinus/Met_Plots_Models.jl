# Met_Plots_Models

## The Motivation for this package

As a meteorologist, I plan a lot of drafty figures in my research.  But plotting meteorological figures with most packages in meteorology requires repeative: manually configuring longitude, latitude and sometimes a manually rearrangement of elements when plotting across the Merdian.

This boring tasks are boring.

So I develop this package to plot drafty figures within one or two commands.
