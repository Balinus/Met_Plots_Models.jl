# Met_Plots_Models

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zhujinxuan/Met_Plots_Models.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zhujinxuan/Met_Plots_Models.jl)

## The Motivation for this package

I am bored at seeing me typing the same code for setting coordinations and levels again and again.

Mostly, a meteorologist are analyzing results from one model run, or from different runs by a same model.  Therefore, in one experiment, most of their plotting is according to one set of longitude and latitude.  I think it is not appreciated to set longitude and latitude for plotting in every code file.  In this package, I suggest that we should wrapper longitude and latitude and other coordinations beneath a unified interface.
